# 🧾 FMCG Sales Analysis using Power BI

## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes sales performance from an FMCG (Fast-Moving Consumer Goods) dataset, covering the period from 2014 to 2017.  
Built using **Power BI**, the dashboard provides key insights into revenue, profit, shipping time, discount impact, and product performance.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Evaluate overall business performance (Sales, Profit, Order Volume)
- Identify underperforming products and cities with long shipping times
- Analyze the relationship between discount rate and profitability
- Derive actionable insights to support data-driven decisions

## 📊 Key Metrics

| Metric               | Value       |
|----------------------|-------------|
| Total Sales          | $2,297,201  |
| Total Profit         | $286,397    |
| Total Orders         | 9,994       |
| Average Profit Margin| ~14.3%      |

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **City Analysis:** Lodi has the longest average shipping time (~6.9 days), suggesting logistic inefficiencies
- **Sub-Category Risk:** The “Binders” category has high discount rates (~35%) but negative profit → not an effective promotion
- **Profitability Issue:** Several individual orders resulted in a net loss despite minimal discounts – indicating potential pricing or cost issues
- **Low-margin Channels/Products** identified through combined visual and tabular analysis

---

## 📌 Actionable Recommendations

- 🚚 **Optimize shipping** in cities with delays (e.g., Lodi)
- 💸 **Reduce or re-evaluate discounts** for products with low return on promotion
- 🔍 **Review pricing strategy** for frequently sold but unprofitable items
- 🎯 **Focus marketing and inventory** on high-profit sub-categories with stable performance

## 🛠 Tools Used
